              <h4> 2019 - Current | Universidade da Maia | Business management </h4>
          <p> During my time in the program, I have studied a wide range of business-related topics, including finance, marketing, economics, and organizational behavior. I have also had the opportunity to participate in internships and case studies, which have allowed me to gain practical experience in the business world.</p>

           <p> In addition to the technical skills I have developed, I have also honed my ability to think critically, communicate effectively, and work well in teams. I am confident that these skills will be valuable assets as I begin my career.</p>

                <h4> 2016 - Mobile APP</h4>
            <p> To celebrate World Philosophy Day in 2016, I developed a mobile app designed to engage and inspire the younger generation to explore the subject of philosophy. The app is a word search game featuring philosophical terms and concepts. My goal was to make philosophy more accessible and appealing to a new audience.</p>
                <h4> 2017/2018 - Young business talent</h4>
                <p>Nivea sponsored Young Business Talents (YBT), an event for pre-university students that offers a comprehensive simulation of the business world. Through YBT, participants have the opportunity to start and run their own company, compete with others, make strategic decisions, and adapt their approaches as needed. This hands-on experience allows young people to get a taste of what it's like to work in the business world and to develop valuable skills and knowledge.</p>
                <h4> 2021 - CHALLANJE – Maratona de Criatividade Júnior</h4>
                <p>ChallANJE is a multidisciplinary junior entrepreneurship project that aims to enhance the skills of higher education students through engagement with leading professionals and top-tier companies. By participating in ChallANJE, students have the chance to gain valuable insights and connections in their field, helping them to prepare for successful careers. The project is designed to provide participants with a unique learning experience that combines practical knowledge with real-world exposure.</p>
                <h4> 2022- Google Skills</h4>
                <p>I recently completed the Google Skills: Fundamentals of Digital Marketing course, a comprehensive program covering key concepts and tools in digital marketing. The course includes interactive lessons and hands-on exercises that teach me how to use Google tools and platforms to reach and engage customers online. I learned about topics such as search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and social media marketing. By the end of the course, I had a solid foundation in digital marketing and was able to apply these skills to my own marketing efforts. This course, which is accredited by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, was a great resource for me as a business owner or marketing professional looking to gain a competitive edge in the digital world.</p>
                <h4> 2022- Tradicional market research</h4>
                <p>TPorto Business School was commissioned by Porto City Hall to conduct a project exploring the history and current challenges faced by local businesses. As part of the project, we administered questionnaires to gather insights and identify any issues that arose as a result of the pandemic. Our goal was to provide Porto City Hall with valuable information to help support and strengthen the local business community.</p>
